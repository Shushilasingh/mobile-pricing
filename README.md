# 📱 Mobile Pricing Prediction

This project predicts the price range of mobile phones based on various features like battery power, RAM, screen size, and more. It uses machine learning models to classify phones into four price categories.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset was uploaded and extracted from a ZIP file. It contains features such as:

- Battery power
- RAM
- Internal memory
- Screen width and height
- 4G/3G support
- Number of cores
- And more...

## 🧠 Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**  
   - Accuracy
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - Improved performance over Logistic Regression  
   - Final model used for prediction

## 📊 Evaluation

- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report were used to evaluate model performance.
- SVM showed better generalization and accuracy.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
